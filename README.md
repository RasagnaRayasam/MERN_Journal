# 🧠 MERN Mastery Journal

Welcome to my personal journey of mastering full-stack development using the **MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)** — along with hands-on learning in **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** tools.

This repository is a live tracker of:
- 👨‍💻 My mini projects (like Todo, Calculator, CRUD apps)
- 🧠 Daily learning logs with concepts, code snippets & reflections
- 🚀 My preparation for real-world development.

I'm using this space to:
- Document my growth step-by-step ✍️  
- Keep everything open, honest, and inspiring 💡

Whether you're a beginner trying to learn full-stack, or a recruiter looking at my growth path — this is a transparent view of how I build, break, learn, and grow 💪
